The main theme of the mini project is SVG, with that in mind, i am calling this learning project as “Project SVG”.

###Technologies
Each of the mini projects has different learning purposes, but they are all restrict to the sames technologies, because they are my learning goal, and the reason the project has been created.
They are:
